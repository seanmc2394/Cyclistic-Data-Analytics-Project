# Cyclistic-Data-Analytics-Project

### Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Introduction
This project is based on the Google Data Analytics Specialization Capstone case study: "How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?". The scenario places me in the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The marketing team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights will help design a strategy to encourage more casual riders to become members, since annual memberships are more profitable and key to the company’s long-term growth.

In this project, I’ll be walking through the full analysis process step by step:
1. Ask: Define the business problem.
2. Prepare: Gather and organize Cyclistic’s historical trip data.
3. Process: Clean and transform the dataset for analysis.
4. Analyze: Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover trends.
5. Share: Present findings with charts and explanations.
6. Act: Provide three recommendations based on the insights.

By the end, this project will include:
- A clear business task
- Documentation of data sources and cleaning steps
- Summary of analysis with visualizations
- Three recommendations for Cyclistic’s marketing strategy
- This case study gave me a chance to practice real-world data analysis skills while creating a project I can showcase in my portfolio.
