# Cyclistic-Data-Analytics-Project

### Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Introduction
This project is based on the Google Data Analytics Specialization Capstone case study: "How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?". The scenario places me in the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The marketing team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights will help design a strategy to encourage more casual riders to become members, since annual memberships are more profitable and key to the company’s long-term growth.

In this project, I’ll be walking through the full analysis process step by step:
1. Ask: Define the business problem.
2. Prepare: Gather and organize Cyclistic’s historical trip data.
3. Process: Clean and transform the dataset for analysis.
4. Analyze: Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover trends.
5. Share: Present findings with charts and explanations.
6. Act: Provide three recommendations based on the insights.

By the end, this project will include:
- A clear business task
- Documentation of data sources and cleaning steps
- Summary of analysis with visualizations
- Three recommendations for Cyclistic’s marketing strategy
- This case study gave me a chance to practice real-world data analysis skills while creating a project I can showcase in my portfolio.


## 1. Ask
The first step of this project was to clearly define the business task.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago with two main customer groups:
- Casual riders: People who purchase single-ride or day passes.
- Annual members: Riders who pay for a yearly subscription.

Cyclistic’s marketing team believes that increasing the number of annual members is the key to long-term growth. To do this, they need to better understand how these two groups of riders use the service differently.

### Business Task
Analyze historical ride data to identify usage patterns between casual riders and annual members, and provide insights that can help the marketing team design strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Key Stakeholders
Lily Moreno – Director of Marketing (my manager in this scenario).
Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team – responsible for analyzing and reporting data.
Cyclistic Executive Team – decision-makers who will review the findings and recommendations.

Deliverable for this stage:
A clear statement of the business task (above) and identification of stakeholders.


## 2. Prepare
For this project, I used Cyclistic’s historical trip data from July 2025, which is publicly available through [Divvy Bikes](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). Even though Cyclistic is a fictional company created for the Google Data Analytics course, the dataset is real and provided under an open license by Motivate International Inc. To keep things manageable, I worked with a selected period of data rather than the entire history.

The data comes in CSV format and includes information such as ride IDs, bike type, start and end times, station locations, and whether the rider was a casual user or an annual member. Importantly, the dataset does not contain personal information about riders, which ensures privacy is maintained.

At this stage, the focus was on making sure the files were stored and organized properly, and on checking the source’s reliability. Since the dataset is both credible and openly available, it’s a good foundation for answering the business question.
